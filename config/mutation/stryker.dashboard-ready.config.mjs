/**
 * Mutation testing for apps/dashboard/src/ready.ts (backlog
 * web-msnswvcq-viays2, "MUTATION TESTING") — continuing to widen through
 * apps/dashboard/src's zero-side-effect pure logic.
 *
 * waitForHealth() is the launch-sequence race guard: it decides whether the
 * dashboard's CLI opens a browser tab before the detached server is actually
 * listening. A surviving mutant here (the `res.ok` check flipped, the
 * `now() < deadline` boundary off by one, or the retry loop swallowing the
 * wrong error) could open a browser onto a connection-refused page, or spin
 * forever past the caller's timeout.
 *
 * ready.ts has zero runtime imports — same low-risk shape as
 * security.ts/gate-commands.ts/registry.ts, never touches the
 * better-sqlite3-in-sandbox gap documented in stryker.store.config.mjs.
 *
 * @type {import('@stryker-mutator/api/core').PartialStrykerOptions}
