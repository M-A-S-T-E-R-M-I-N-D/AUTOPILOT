 * Mutation testing for apps/dashboard/src/paths.ts (backlog
 * web-msnswvcq-viays2, "MUTATION TESTING") — continuing to widen through
 * apps/dashboard/src's zero-side-effect pure logic.
 *
 * samePath() decides whether a project's stored `root_path` matches a folder
 * the caller passed in — including the win32 case-insensitive comparison
 * NTFS actually uses. A surviving mutant here (the platform check inverted,
 * `toLowerCase` dropped, or `resolve` skipped) could make a real project
 * look unmatched — or two different folders look like the same one.
 *
 * paths.ts has zero runtime imports beyond node:path — same low-risk shape
 * as gate-commands.ts/registry.ts/runner.ts/rate-limit.ts, never touches the
 * better-sqlite3-in-sandbox gap documented in stryker.store.config.mjs.
 *
 * @type {import('@stryker-mutator/api/core').PartialStrykerOptions}
