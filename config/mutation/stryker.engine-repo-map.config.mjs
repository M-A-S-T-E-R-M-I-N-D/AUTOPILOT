/**
 * Mutation testing for packages/engine/src/repo-map.ts (backlog
 * web-msnswvcq-viays2, "MUTATION TESTING") — the sixth module wired after
 * store's rank.ts + schema.ts (stryker.store.config.mjs), engine's
 * release.ts + pace.ts (stryker.engine-release.config.mjs,
 * stryker.engine-pace.config.mjs), containment.ts
 * (stryker.engine-containment.config.mjs), and inbox.ts
 * (stryker.engine-inbox.config.mjs), widening one more self-contained
 * slice.
 *
 * repo-map.ts is the same shape of good target the prior modules were: zero
 * imports (a fully self-contained pure module that renders the REPO-MAP
 * orientation digest spliced into the firing prompt, and tallies recent-
 * commit focus dirs, see the module's own header) and its test file drives
 * it with plain in-memory arrays, never a real filesystem read or a
 * database connection. Widening further (anything that still imports
 * adapters/git.ts transitively, or spawns a subprocess in its own tests)
 * remains a follow-up slice, same reasoning as the five prior configs.
 * guard.ts was tried as this slice's target first but its regex-heavy
 * PreToolUse command guard surfaced 118 surviving mutants plus 10
 * no-coverage — too large a gap to close in one firing; it stays a
 * follow-up target sized for its own dedicated slice(s).
 *
 * The two Windows-specific fixes below were required for the prior configs'
 * narrow scope even without a native addon or subprocess in the mutated
 * file itself — Stryker's sandboxed copy of the tree is enough on its own
 * to trip them — so both carry over here defensively.
 *
 * @type {import('@stryker-mutator/api/core').PartialStrykerOptions}
